# What is the problem?
The stock market could be a vehicle for wealth generation. This work aims to identify a selected few high-performance public companies from their business fundamental data (balance sheet, income and cashflow statements). 

Stock market is immensely complex and it is hoped that this analyses will reveal important financial numbers associated with stock price movement. 

**WARNING**: This work is not intended as financial advice. 

# Approach
(1) Gather data

(2) Calculate compound annual growth return (CAGR) 

(3) Calculate ratios and other growth rates

(4) Identify features that correlate with high CAGR using machine learning

# Limitations
Due to changes in economic cycles and/or company governance, historic data may not be reliable as future predictors. Stock market is an example of second-order chaotic systems (https://danielmiessler.com/p/first-second-order-chaos/) because it responds to the prediction. A stock price (and market) is an aggregate of buyers' and sellers' sentiments that can be largely driven by emotions (fear, greed and so on) rather than logic.
